# Guess the number game

In this game the user tries to guess the random number generated by the computer. The user can turn on or off the tips in the game. 

This game was created to produce something that had conditions. 

The commands to play are: 

`(play-guess-number-game)`
`(my-guess 10)` 10 is any number between 0 and 100.
`(tips-on)`
`(tips-off)`

This game is based on the game guess-my-number from the book Land of Lisp. The main idea comes from this game anyway, but it was changed to fit the things I wanted to try in this program.
