# Guess the number game

In this game the user tries to guess the random number generated by the computer. The user can turn on or off the tips in the game. 

This game was created to produce something that had conditions. 

The commands to play are: 

`(play-guess-number-game)`
`(my-guess 10)` 10 is any number between 0 and 100.
`(tips-on)`
`(tips-off)`

This game is based on the game guess-my-number from the book Land of Lisp. The main idea comes from this game anyway, but it was changed to fit the things I wanted to try in this program. 

## Update

I added a custom REPL. I learned it from another game from the same book. I saw that it would be a good fit for this game, and implemented it in here. 

to play using the REPL, which is more user friendly, go to the Lisp REPL and use the command:

`(game-repl)`

Inside the custom REPL, you can use several commands like:

`play` -> to start the game.

`guess any-int-number` -> to make a guess.

`tips on` -> to get a feedback on the guesses.

`tips off` -> to play in a way harder level.

`help` -> it pretty much displays this short descriptions for each command.

`quit` -> to get out of the REPL.
